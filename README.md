# Sodoku-Project
I built this interactive Sodoku game using Python and Pygame. The project features a clean, user friendly interface with a start menu for selecting difficulty(Easy, Medium, or Hard), a dynamically rendered Sudoku grid, and functional buttons for resetting, restarting, or exiting the game. I used custom functions to build reusable UI elements like buttons and menus, and applied conditional logic to manage screen transitions. 

The game board is a 9x9 grind dynamically drawn with line thickness that emphasize the 3x3 subgrids. I implemented the core loop to manage screen transitions and basic game flow.

This project displays design thinking by implementing a clear visual layout as well as proficieny in core programming concepts such as functons, conditional loops, and modular code design, all implemented in Python using Pygame library. 

Overall this project highlights my ability to structure clean, readable code, manage game states, and build interactive applications from the ground up. It reflects a strong understanding of control flow, code organization, and creating engaging user interface.
